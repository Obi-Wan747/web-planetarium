# [Project Title]

## MVP

Project Use Case: 
To provide accurate and personalized night sky predictions and simulations usable by stargazing amateurs. Also includes some features helpful for astrophotography planning. 

USP from other projects with the same use case:
Simulations are highly personalized to include various visibility-impeding properties of the specified location, such as light pollution, air pollution, cloud cover, moonlight glare, and more.
Also enables DSO target query actions by catalog.

Bare minimum features needed to satisfy use case:
- Mobile-first PWA
- Select location (restrict to current time)
- 360Ëš WebGL view
- View solar system objects and naked-eye visible stars
- View surrounding elevation(?)

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Building a House
*Setup a server that:*
  - *Serves a basic html file with a WebGL canvas saying "hello" in 3D*
  - *Exposes a basic GraphQL endpoint returning "world"*
- [ ] Todo items for this phase, in order

### Phase 2: Going Grocery Shopping
*Collect the necessary data from free resources that would be needed for the MVP (for example, what stars can we see from where)*
- [ ] Todo items for this phase, in order
      
### Phase 3: Learning to Cook
*Backend: Given a location, accurately determine and communicate the visible things in the sky* \
*Frontend: Communicate a specific hard-coded location to server and accurately display what it spits back*
- [ ] Todo items for this phase, in order

### Phase 4: Open a Catering Business
