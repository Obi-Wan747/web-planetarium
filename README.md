## MVP
Project Use Case: personalized night sky simulation for amateur astronomy and astrophotography planning

USP from other projects with the same use case: location details, weather conditions, DSO target selection/sorting/listing/filtering (M/NGC/IC/SH2)

Bare minimum features needed to satisfy use case: 
- non-laggy and doesn't make computer freeze every 5 minutes
- solar system, Messier, NOMAD (or other aggregate general star catalog) objects
- rough visibility adjustment according to Bortle data
- location and time setting

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Building a House
*Setup a server that:*
  - *Serves a basic html file with a WebGL canvas saying "hello" in 3D*
  - *Exposes a basic GraphQL endpoint returning "world"*
- [ ] Todo items for this phase, in order

### Phase 2: Going Grocery Shopping
*Collect the necessary data from free resources that would be needed for the MVP (for example, what stars can we see from where)*
- [ ] Todo items for this phase, in order
      
### Phase 3: Learning to Cook
*Backend: Given a location, accurately determine and communicate the visible things in the sky* \
*Frontend: Communicate a specific hard-coded location to server and accurately display what it spits back*
- [ ] Todo items for this phase, in order

### Phase 4: Open a Catering Business
